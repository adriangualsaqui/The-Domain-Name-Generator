<ol>
    <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
</ol>

## 📝Proyect instructions

1. Create a function that clears the shit array using declarative programming (split, join, or any of them). The function should only leave the strings as the result.
2. Create a function that calculates the distance between two points using the object that I gave you as Point, you must use imperative programming for this exercise. Your   
   function must take two parameters, point a and point b and calculate the distance.
3. Create a function that compares the values of exampleArray2 and exampleArray1 but looks at the type (y2-y1, x2-x1)
4. Create a function that finds the value 4 in the exampleArray array:
   - You must create an algorithm using functional programming
   - You must create another algorithm using declarative programming (filter, split, reduce or any of them that manipulate arrays)

## :white_check_mark: Instructions for use

1. Make sure you are located in the project directory (scripts).
2. Run node index.js in terminal.
